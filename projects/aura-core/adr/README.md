# Architecture Decision Records

Short, dated records of significant architectural decisions. Each ADR captures:

- **Context** — the situation that required a decision
- **Decision** — what was chosen
- **Alternatives** — what else was considered and why it was rejected
- **Consequences** — what this decision implies, positive and negative

ADRs are append-only. If a decision is reversed, a new ADR supersedes the old one — the original is never deleted or edited in substance.

## Format

Based on Michael Nygard's original template, lightly adapted.
